* The main loop is shoddy. The problem lies in Python's lack of gaming libraries
  and that the available libraries are terribly documented. However, most other
  emulators don't sync on CPU cycles anyway, and always assume 70224 cycles per
  frame.
* The APU is a mess and non-functional. Python, even with PyPy, is probably
  simply too slow for this. It doesn't help that the audio APIs are lacking and
  underdocumented
* STOP instruction
* Joypad interrupt unimplemented. It is apparently not used, so I can hardly test
  it
* RTC for MBC3 is not implemented
* The serial module is just a stub. It prints out all data sent out over it
  for debugging purposes.
* VRAM can be freely accessed during mode 3, because enforcing this access
  violation would imply an extra branch for every read
